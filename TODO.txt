- do the fucking scoring system already
- replace string keybind references with constants
- ui.ButtonMenu
	- simpler interface for handling multiple buttons
	- keep buttons in a dict rather than a list
	- void handleEvent(event)
		- deal with key presses, mouse movements, and clicks
		- intended to be called within event loop
	- void draw(surface)
	- void addButton(key, text, pos, size, func = None, args = None)
	- void setButtonFunc(key, func, args)
	- void setButtonKBNav(key, target_key, dirs = 0b0000)
		- target_key: key of button to navigate to when dir pressed
		- dirs: 4 bits describing which directional buttons trigger navigation
			1000: up, 0100: down, 0010: left, 0001: right
	- void setDefaultNavpoint(key, dirs = 0b1111)
		- set which button will highlight on keypress if no buttons are highlighted
		- dirs controls which directional buttons trigger this (all on by default)
	- UIButton getButton(key)
- figure out any kind of faster, cleaner way to make pygame surfaces work within opengl
- rename misc.buttons to misc.binds
- rename ui.surface to literally anything less ambiguous
- untangle the clusterfuck that is start_new_bar
	- also figure out a way to *competently* draw dots before the bar comes up
- move gameplay opengl draw calls to somewhere inside the chart
	- this is literally arbitrary code execution so try to protect against nasty shenanigans
