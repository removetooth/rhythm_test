- do the fucking scoring system already
- replace string keybind references with constants
- figure out any kind of faster, cleaner way to make pygame surfaces work within opengl
- rename misc.buttons to misc.binds
- rename ui.surface to literally anything less ambiguous
- untangle the clusterfuck that is start_new_bar
	- also figure out a way to *competently* draw dots before the bar comes up
- move gameplay opengl draw calls to somewhere inside the chart
	- this is literally arbitrary code execution so try to protect against nasty shenanigans
